        Paper produced with love, devotion, passion - is not the same paper. Our
        supplies are extra strong, and you’re going to need the paper-tear
        up-master to destroy just one sheet. It’s also suited for every
        available printer.

        You know that feeling when you are waiting on the phone for hours to
        contact your supplier? Sometimes they even have a waiting time music
        prepared for that. In Dunder Mifflin, you can get help immediately, and
        each of our customers receives an individual assistant. For us,
        companies are people - not numbers, so we take care of each of them.

        If you buy one of our business plans, you will receive the supplies
        every first Monday of the month. However, you can also purchase paper
        separately. Our employees will make sure that you will receive the
        products in the next business days.

        The whole process depends on your decision. If you sign the contract
        immediately, we can start official cooperation in the next two business
        days.
